##  What is MET?

**MET = Metabolic Equivalent of Task**

Think of MET as a "multiplier" that tells you how hard an activity is compared to sitting still.

### Simple Explanation:
- **1 MET** = Sitting on the couch watching TV
- **3 METs** = The activity burns **3 times** more calories than sitting
- **8 METs** = The activity burns **8 times** more calories than sitting

### MET Scale:
```
1 MET     = Resting (sitting, watching TV)
2-3 METs  = Light activity (slow walking)
4-6 METs  = Moderate activity (weight lifting, wrestling)
7-9 METs  = Vigorous activity (football practice, running)
10+ METs  = Very vigorous (sprinting, intense sports)
```

##  MET Table for Your Activities

| Activity | MET Value | How Hard? |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Walking** (3 mph, moderate pace) | **3.5** | Light - Easy breathing |
| **Running** (6 mph, jogging) | **10.0** | Vigorous - Hard breathing |
| **Weight Lifting** (moderate effort) | **5.0** | Moderate - Breathing harder |
| **Wrestling** (practice or match) | **6.0** | Vigorous - Working hard |
| **Football Practice** | **8.0** | Vigorous - Very hard work |

##  The Calorie Burn Formula

### Main Formula:
```
Calories Burned = MET × Your Weight (kg) × Time (hours)
```

### Breaking It Down:

**What you need:**
1. **MET value** - From the table above
2. **Your weight in kilograms** - Convert from pounds: weight ÷ 2.2
3. **Time in hours** - Convert from minutes: minutes ÷ 60

---

##  Example 1: Walking

**You:** 165 lbs student  
**Activity:** Walking at moderate pace  
**Time:** 30 minutes

### Step-by-Step:

**Step 1: Find the MET value**
```
Walking = 3.5 METs
```

**Step 2: Convert your weight to kg**
```
165 lbs ÷ 2.2 = 75 kg
```

**Step 3: Convert minutes to hours**
```
30 minutes ÷ 60 = 0.5 hours
```

**Step 4: Calculate calories**
```
Calories = 3.5 × 75 × 0.5
Calories = 131
```

** Answer: You burned 131 calories walking for 30 minutes**

---

##  Example 2: Running

**You:** 150 lbs student  
**Activity:** Running/jogging  
**Time:** 20 minutes

### Step-by-Step:

**Step 1: Find the MET value**
```
Running = 10.0 METs
```

**Step 2: Convert your weight to kg**
```
150 lbs ÷ 2.2 = 68 kg
```

**Step 3: Convert minutes to hours**
```
20 minutes ÷ 60 = 0.33 hours
```

**Step 4: Calculate calories**
```
Calories = 10.0 × 68 × 0.33
Calories = 224
```

** Answer: You burned 224 calories running for 20 minutes**

---

##  Example 3: Weight Lifting

**You:** 180 lbs student  
**Activity:** Weight lifting (moderate intensity)  
**Time:** 45 minutes

### Step-by-Step:

**Step 1: Find the MET value**
```
Weight Lifting = 5.0 METs
```

**Step 2: Convert your weight to kg**
```
180 lbs ÷ 2.2 = 82 kg
```

**Step 3: Convert minutes to hours**
```
45 minutes ÷ 60 = 0.75 hours
```

**Step 4: Calculate calories**
```
Calories = 5.0 × 82 × 0.75
Calories = 308
```

** Answer: You burned 308 calories lifting weights for 45 minutes**

---

##  Example 4: Wrestling

**You:** 155 lbs wrestler  
**Activity:** Wrestling practice  
**Time:** 90 minutes (1 hour 30 min)

### Step-by-Step:

**Step 1: Find the MET value**
```
Wrestling = 6.0 METs
```

**Step 2: Convert your weight to kg**
```
155 lbs ÷ 2.2 = 70 kg
```

**Step 3: Convert minutes to hours**
```
90 minutes ÷ 60 = 1.5 hours
```

**Step 4: Calculate calories**
```
Calories = 6.0 × 70 × 1.5
Calories = 630
```

** Answer: You burned 630 calories during wrestling practice**

---

##  Example 5: Football Practice

**You:** 190 lbs football player  
**Activity:** Football practice (drills, scrimmage)  
**Time:** 90 minutes (1 hour 30 min)

### Step-by-Step:

**Step 1: Find the MET value**
```
Football Practice = 8.0 METs
```

**Step 2: Convert your weight to kg**
```
190 lbs ÷ 2.2 = 86 kg
```

**Step 3: Convert minutes to hours**
```
90 minutes ÷ 60 = 1.5 hours
```

**Step 4: Calculate calories**
```
Calories = 8.0 × 86 × 1.5
Calories = 1,032
```

** Answer: You burned 1,032 calories during football practice**

---

##  Example 6: Full Day (Multiple Activities)

**You:** 165 lbs student  
**Your day:**
- Walking to/from school: 40 minutes total
- Weight lifting in gym class: 30 minutes
- Football practice: 60 minutes

### Calculate Each Activity:

**Your weight in kg:** 165 ÷ 2.2 = 75 kg

**Walking (40 minutes):**
```
3.5 × 75 × (40 ÷ 60)
= 3.5 × 75 × 0.67
= 175 calories
```

**Weight Lifting (30 minutes):**
```
5.0 × 75 × (30 ÷ 60)
= 5.0 × 75 × 0.5
= 188 calories
```

**Football Practice (60 minutes):**
```
8.0 × 75 × (60 ÷ 60)
= 8.0 × 75 × 1.0
= 600 calories
```

**Total for the day:**
```
175 + 188 + 600 = 963 calories burned
```

** Answer: You burned 963 calories total today**

Time: 50 ÷ 60 = 0.83 hours
Calories: 5.0 × 66 × 0.83 = 274 calories
```

### Problem 3 Answer:
```
Weight: 160 ÷ 2.2 = 73 kg
Time: 45 ÷ 60 = 0.75 hours
Calories: 3.5 × 73 × 0.75 = 192 calories
```

##  Key Takeaways

1. **Higher MET = More Calories Burned**
   - Walking (3.5) burns less than running (10.0)

2. **Heavier People Burn More Calories**
   - A 200 lb person burns more than a 150 lb person doing the same activity

3. **Longer Time = More Calories**
   - 60 minutes burns twice as much as 30 minutes

4. **The Formula is Simple**
   - MET × Weight (kg) × Time (hours) = Calories

5. **Always Convert First**
   - Pounds  Kilograms (÷ 2.2)
   - Minutes  Hours (÷ 60)
