# 🪟 Windows Setup Guide for CalTrack

## For Complete Beginners - Step by Step

---

## ✅ Step 1: Install Node.js

### Why?
Node.js includes `npm`, which we need to install React and run the project.

### How to Install:

1. **Download Node.js:**
   - Go to: https://nodejs.org/
   - Click the **LTS** button (recommended version)
   - Download will start automatically

2. **Run the Installer:**
   - Open the downloaded `.msi` file
   - Click "Next" through all steps
   - **Important:** Check the box that says "Automatically install the necessary tools"
   - Click "Install"
   - Wait for completion (may take a few minutes)

3. **Verify Installation:**
   - Press `Win + R`
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter
   - In the black window, type:
     ```
     node --version
     ```
   - You should see something like: `v20.11.0`
   - Then type:
     ```
     npm --version
     ```
   - You should see something like: `10.2.4`

✅ **If you see version numbers, Node.js is installed!**

## ✅ Step 2: Open Project in VS Code

### If You Don't Have VS Code:
1. Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install it (click Next through everything)

### Open CalTrack Project:
1. Open VS Code
2. Click **File** → **Open Folder**
3. Navigate to your CalTrack folder
4. Click **Select Folder**

## ✅ Step 3: Open Terminal in VS Code

### Method 1:
- Press `Ctrl + ` (that's the backtick key, usually above Tab)

### Method 2:
- Click **Terminal** menu → **New Terminal**

### Method 3:
- Click **View** menu → **Terminal**

You should see a panel at the bottom of VS Code with a command line.

## ✅ Step 4: Install Project Dependencies

In the terminal, type:

```bash
npm install
```

Press **Enter** and wait.

### What's Happening?
- npm is downloading all required packages
- This might take 2-5 minutes
- You'll see lots of text scrolling - that's normal!
- When done, you'll see your cursor blinking again

### Troubleshooting:

**Problem:** "npm is not recognized"  
**Solution:** Node.js isn't installed properly. Restart your computer and try Step 1 again.

**Problem:** Installation fails with errors  
**Solution:** 
1. Close VS Code
2. Delete the `node_modules` folder (if it exists)
3. Open VS Code again
4. Run `npm install` again

## ✅ Step 5: Start the Development Server

In the same terminal, type:

```bash
npm start
```

Press **Enter**.

### What's Happening?
- React development server is starting
- Your default browser will open automatically
- You'll see CalTrack running at http://localhost:3000
- **Don't close the terminal!** The server needs to keep running
