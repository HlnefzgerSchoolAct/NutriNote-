## Form Validation Patterns

### Real-Time Validation
- Validate on blur (after user leaves field)
- Show errors immediately
- Clear errors on fix

### Submit Validation
- Validate all on submit
- Focus first error field
- Show summary message

### Success States
- Green checkmark on valid field
- Positive feedback
- Enable submit button

## Data Persistence Strategy

### What to Store
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('userProfile', JSON.stringify({
  age, gender, height, weight, activityLevel
}));

localStorage.setItem('userGoal', JSON.stringify({
  goalType, calorieAdjustment, dailyTarget
}));

localStorage.setItem('todayLog', JSON.stringify({
  date, foodEntries[], activityEntries[]
}));

localStorage.setItem('history', JSON.stringify([
  { date, totalEaten, totalBurned, target }
]));
```

### When to Save
- Profile: On setup completion, on edit save
- Goal: On goal selection
- Log entries: Immediately on add/delete
- History: End of day (midnight)

### When to Load
- App startup: Load all
- Screen navigation: Load relevant data
- New day: Reset daily log, archive yesterday
