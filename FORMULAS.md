# Hawk Fuel - Calculation Formulas

## Unit Conversions

### Weight: Pounds to Kilograms
```
weight_kg = weight_lbs ÷ 2.20462
```

**Example:**
```
165 lbs ÷ 2.20462 = 74.84 kg
```

### Height: Feet & Inches to Centimeters
```
total_inches = (feet × 12) + inches
height_cm = total_inches × 2.54
```

**Example:**
```
5 feet 10 inches
= (5 × 12) + 10
= 60 + 10
= 70 inches
= 70 × 2.54
= 177.8 cm
```

## BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) - Mifflin-St Jeor Equation

### Formula for Men
```
BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) + 5
```

### Formula for Women
```
BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) - 161
```

### What BMR Means
The number of calories your body burns at complete rest just to stay alive (breathing, circulation, cell production, etc.).

## Example Calculation: Male Student

### Given Inputs
```
Age: 16 years
Sex: Male
Height: 5 feet 10 inches
Weight: 165 lbs
```

### Step 1: Convert Weight to Kilograms
```
weight_kg = 165 ÷ 2.20462
weight_kg = 74.84 kg
```

### Step 2: Convert Height to Centimeters
```
total_inches = (5 × 12) + 10 = 70 inches
height_cm = 70 × 2.54 = 177.8 cm
```

### Step 3: Calculate BMR (Male Formula)
```
BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) + 5

BMR = (10 × 74.84) + (6.25 × 177.8) - (5 × 16) + 5

BMR = 748.4 + 1,111.25 - 80 + 5

BMR = 1,784.65 calories/day
```

**Rounded Result: 1,785 cal/day**

---

## Example Calculation: Female Student

### Given Inputs
```
Age: 15 years
Sex: Female
Height: 5 feet 4 inches
Weight: 130 lbs
```

### Step 1: Convert Weight to Kilograms
```
weight_kg = 130 ÷ 2.20462
weight_kg = 58.97 kg
```

### Step 2: Convert Height to Centimeters
```
total_inches = (5 × 12) + 4 = 64 inches
height_cm = 64 × 2.54 = 162.56 cm
```

### Step 3: Calculate BMR (Female Formula)
```
BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) - 161

BMR = (10 × 58.97) + (6.25 × 162.56) - (5 × 15) - 161

BMR = 589.7 + 1,016 - 75 - 161

BMR = 1,369.7 calories/day
```

**Rounded Result: 1,370 cal/day**

---

## Maintenance Calories (TDEE - Total Daily Energy Expenditure)

### Formula
```
TDEE = BMR × Activity_Multiplier
```

### Activity Multipliers

| Activity Level | Description | Multiplier |
|----------------|-------------|------------|
| **Sedentary** | Little or no exercise, desk job | **1.2** |
| **Lightly Active** | Light exercise 1-3 days/week | **1.375** |
| **Moderately Active** | Moderate exercise 3-5 days/week | **1.55** |
| **Very Active** | Hard exercise 6-7 days/week | **1.725** |
| **Extra Active** | Athlete or very physical job | **1.9** |

---

## Example: Maintenance Calories

### Male Student (from above)
```
BMR: 1,785 cal/day
Activity Level: Moderately Active (exercises 4 days/week)
Activity Multiplier: 1.55

TDEE = 1,785 × 1.55
TDEE = 2,766.75 calories/day
```

**Rounded Result: 2,767 cal/day**

This is the number of calories to eat daily to **maintain current weight**.

### Female Student (from above)
```
BMR: 1,370 cal/day
Activity Level: Lightly Active (exercises 2 days/week)
Activity Multiplier: 1.375

TDEE = 1,370 × 1.375
TDEE = 1,883.75 calories/day
```

**Rounded Result: 1,884 cal/day**

---

## Weight Loss (Calorie Deficit)

### Formula
```
Daily_Target = TDEE - Deficit_Amount
```

### Deficit Recommendations

| Deficit | Weight Loss Rate | Use Case |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **-250 cal/day** | ~0.5 lbs/week | Slow, sustainable |
| **-500 cal/day** | ~1 lb/week | **Recommended** |
| **-750 cal/day** | ~1.5 lbs/week | Aggressive (consult coach) |

### Science Behind It
```
1 pound of body fat = approximately 3,500 calories

Daily deficit × 7 days = Weekly calorie deficit
Weekly deficit ÷ 3,500 = Pounds lost per week

Example:
-500 cal/day × 7 days = -3,500 cal/week
-3,500 ÷ 3,500 = 1 lb/week
```

### Example: Male Student Wants to Lose Weight
```
TDEE: 2,767 cal/day
Goal: Lose 1 lb/week
Deficit: -500 cal/day

Daily_Target = 2,767 - 500
Daily_Target = 2,267 cal/day
```

**He should eat 2,267 calories per day to lose ~1 lb/week**

### Example: Female Student Wants to Lose Weight
```
TDEE: 1,884 cal/day
Goal: Lose 0.5 lb/week
Deficit: -250 cal/day

Daily_Target = 1,884 - 250
Daily_Target = 1,634 cal/day
```

**She should eat 1,634 calories per day to lose ~0.5 lb/week**

---

## Weight Gain (Calorie Surplus)

### Formula
```
Daily_Target = TDEE + Surplus_Amount
```

### Surplus Recommendations

| Surplus | Weight Gain Rate | Use Case |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **+250 cal/day** | ~0.5 lbs/week | Lean muscle gain |
| **+500 cal/day** | ~1 lb/week | **Recommended** |
| **+750 cal/day** | ~1.5 lbs/week | Bulking (consult coach) |

### Example: Male Student Wants to Gain Muscle
```
TDEE: 2,767 cal/day
Goal: Gain 1 lb/week
Surplus: +500 cal/day

Daily_Target = 2,767 + 500
Daily_Target = 3,267 cal/day
```

**He should eat 3,267 calories per day to gain ~1 lb/week**

### Example: Female Student Wants to Gain Muscle
```
TDEE: 1,884 cal/day
Goal: Gain 0.5 lb/week
Surplus: +250 cal/day

Daily_Target = 1,884 + 250
Daily_Target = 2,134 cal/day
```

**She should eat 2,134 calories per day to gain ~0.5 lb/week**

## Calories Burned from Exercise (MET System)

### What is MET?

**MET = Metabolic Equivalent of Task**

A MET is a way to measure how much energy your body uses during physical activity compared to sitting at rest.

- **1 MET** = Sitting quietly, watching TV (your resting metabolic rate)
- **3 METs** = Activity burns 3 times more calories than resting
- **8 METs** = Activity burns 8 times more calories than resting

**Higher MET value = More intense activity = More calories burned**

### Calorie Burn Formula
```
Calories_Burned = MET × weight_kg × duration_hours
```

**Alternative (when using minutes):**
```
Calories_Burned = MET × weight_kg × (duration_minutes ÷ 60)
```

**MET** = Metabolic Equivalent of Task (how many times more energy than resting)

### MET Table for Common Student Activities

| Activity | MET Value | Intensity Level |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Walking (3 mph, moderate pace)** | **3.5** | Light |
| **Running (6 mph, jogging)** | **10.0** | Vigorous |
| **Weight Lifting (moderate effort)** | **5.0** | Moderate |
| **Weight Lifting (vigorous effort)** | **6.0** | Vigorous |
| **Wrestling (practice or match)** | **6.0** | Vigorous |
| **Football Practice** | **8.0** | Vigorous |
| Cycling (moderate pace) | 7.5 | Moderate |
| Basketball | 6.5 | Moderate-Vigorous |
| Soccer | 7.0 | Vigorous |
| Swimming (moderate) | 6.0 | Moderate |
| Yoga | 2.5 | Light |
| HIIT Training | 8.0 | Vigorous |
| Sports Practice (general) | 5.0 | Moderate |

## Why Use MET Values?

### Advantages:
1. **Scientifically Validated** - Based on extensive research
2. **Accounts for Body Weight** - Heavier people burn more calories
3. **Easy to Understand** - Simple multiplication formula
4. **Standardized** - Consistent across different apps and calculators
5. **Comprehensive** - MET values exist for hundreds of activities

### How METs Are Determined:
Scientists measure oxygen consumption during activities in laboratory settings. The more oxygen your body uses, the more calories you burn.

```
1 MET = 3.5 mL of oxygen per kg of body weight per minute
```

### Example: Male Student Runs for 30 Minutes
```
Activity: Running
MET: 8.0
Weight: 74.84 kg (from earlier conversion)
Duration: 30 minutes

Calories_Burned = 8.0 × 74.84 × (30 ÷ 60)
Calories_Burned = 8.0 × 74.84 × 0.5
Calories_Burned = 298.72 calories
```

**Rounded Result: 299 calories burned**

### Example: Female Student Does Yoga for 45 Minutes
```
Activity: Yoga
MET: 2.5
Weight: 58.97 kg (from earlier conversion)
Duration: 45 minutes

Calories_Burned = 2.5 × 58.97 × (45 ÷ 60)
Calories_Burned = 2.5 × 58.97 × 0.75
Calories_Burned = 110.57 calories
```

**Rounded Result: 111 calories burned**

---

## Daily Net Calories

### Formula
```
Net_Calories = Calories_Eaten - Calories_Burned_From_Exercise
```

### Example: Male Student's Day
```
Daily Target (for weight loss): 2,267 cal
Calories Eaten (food logged): 2,100 cal
Calories Burned (30 min running): 299 cal

Net_Calories = 2,100 - 299
Net_Calories = 1,801 cal

Remaining for the day = 2,267 - 1,801 = 466 cal
```

**He can eat 466 more calories and still meet his goal.**

### Example: Female Student's Day
```
Daily Target (for maintenance): 1,884 cal
Calories Eaten (food logged): 1,650 cal
Calories Burned (45 min yoga): 111 cal

Net_Calories = 1,650 - 111
Net_Calories = 1,539 cal

Remaining for the day = 1,884 - 1,539 = 345 cal
```

**She can eat 345 more calories and maintain her weight.**
