- **Over target:** "You're X calories over your target."

### ✅ localStorage Persistence
All data saves automatically:
- User profile (stays forever)

- Food log (resets at midnight)
- Exercise log (resets at midnight)
- Current date (for reset detection)

### ✅ Automatic Daily Reset

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### React Hooks Used

1. **useState** - 8 state variables in Dashboard
   - Form inputs (foodName, foodCalories, etc.)
   - Logs (foodLog, exerciseLog)
   - Totals (caloriesEaten, caloriesBurned, etc.)

2. **useEffect** - 2 hooks
   - Load saved data on component mount
   - Recalculate totals when logs change

### localStorage Pattern

```javascript
// SAVE
localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(data))

// LOAD
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key))

// DELETE
localStorage.removeItem(key)
```

### Data Flow

```
User Input → State Update → localStorage Save → UI Update
     ↑                                              ↓
     └────────────── Page Refresh ─────────────────┘
              (Data loaded from localStorage)
```
