##  Common Beginner Questions

**Q: What is React?**  
A: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It breaks your UI into reusable components.

**Q: What is a component?**  
A: A component is a reusable piece of UI code. Think of it like a LEGO block - you combine them to build your app.

**Q: What does `npm` do?**  
A: npm (Node Package Manager) installs and manages JavaScript packages (libraries) your project needs.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**  
A: Yes! After the first load, the PWA features allow offline use.

**Q: How do I add new features?**  
A: Create a new component in `src/components/` and import it into `App.js`.
