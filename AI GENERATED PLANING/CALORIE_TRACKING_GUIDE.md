#  Hawk Fuel - Daily Calorie Tracking Guide

## Overview

Hawk Fuel now includes **daily calorie tracking** with localStorage persistence! This means you can:

-  Log food you eat
-  Log exercise calories burned
-  See real-time daily totals
-  Track calories remaining
-  All data saves automatically (survives browser refresh!)
-  Resets daily at midnight

---

## How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Initial Setup** (Steps 1-3)
   - Enter your profile (age, weight, height, gender)
   - Select your activity level and goal
   - Log planned activities
   - See your calculated daily calorie target

2. **Daily Tracking** (Step 4 - Dashboard)
   - **Log Food**: Add what you eat with calorie amounts
   - **Log Exercise**: Add workouts with calories burned
   - **View Totals**: See your progress in real-time
   - **Get Guidance**: App tells you exactly how much to eat/burn

### Dashboard Features

####  Summary Cards

Four cards at the top show:

1. ** Daily Target** - Your goal calories for the day
2. ** Eaten** - Total calories consumed
3. ** Burned** - Total calories from exercise
4. ** Remaining** - How many calories left to reach goal

**Formula:**
```
Remaining = Daily Target - (Eaten - Burned)
```

####  Food Logging

**How to log food:**
1. Type food name (e.g., "Grilled chicken")
2. Enter calories (e.g., 250)
3. Click "+ Add Food"
4. Food appears in list below
5. Click  to delete if you made a mistake

**Example entries:**
- Breakfast: Oatmeal - 300 cal
- Lunch: Turkey sandwich - 450 cal
- Snack: Apple - 95 cal
- Dinner: Salmon with rice - 600 cal

####  Exercise Logging

**How to log exercise:**
1. Type exercise name (e.g., "Running")
2. Enter calories burned (e.g., 400)
3. Click "+ Add Exercise"
4. Exercise appears in list below
5. Click  to delete if needed

**How to calculate calories burned:**
- Use the Activity Tracker (Step 2) to plan activities with MET values
- Or use online calculators
- Or use fitness tracker devices (Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc.)

**Example entries:**
- Morning run - 400 cal
- Weight training - 250 cal
- Basketball game - 500 cal

####  Guidance Messages

The app gives you helpful messages:

** Under target:**
> You can eat **500 more calories** to reach your goal!

** Perfect:**
> Perfect! You've hit your target exactly!

** Over target:**
> You're **200 calories over** your target.

## localStorage Explained (For Beginners)

### What is localStorage?

**localStorage** is like a notebook built into your web browser:

- **Persistent**: Data stays even after closing browser
- **Per-browser**: Each browser has its own storage
- **No server needed**: All data stored locally on your computer
- **Automatic**: Hawk Fuel saves everything for you

### What Gets Saved?

Hawk Fuel saves 5 things to localStorage:

1. **User Profile**
   - Your age, weight, height, gender
   - Activity level and goal
   - Custom calorie adjustments

2. **Daily Target**
   - Your calculated daily calorie goal
   - Based on BMR, TDEE, and goals

3. **Food Log**
   - All food entries for today
   - Name and calories for each item
   - Timestamps

4. **Exercise Log**
   - All exercise entries for today
   - Name and calories for each workout
   - Timestamps

5. **Current Date**
   - Today's date
   - Used to reset logs at midnight

### When Does Data Reset?

**Daily logs reset automatically at midnight:**

- Food log clears (new day = new meals)
- Exercise log clears (new day = new workouts)
- User profile stays (your info doesn't change daily)
- Daily target stays (your goal is consistent)

**Example:**
- Monday: Log breakfast, lunch, dinner
- Tuesday midnight: Food/exercise logs clear
- Tuesday: Start fresh logging for new day

### How to Clear All Data

Click the **" Start New Calculation"** button in the Dashboard to:
- Clear all localStorage data
- Return to Step 1 (User Profile)
- Start completely fresh

## Code Structure (For Students)

### New Files Created

#### 1. `src/utils/localStorage.js`

**Purpose**: All localStorage operations

**Key Functions:**
```javascript
// Save data
saveToLocalStorage(key, data)

// Load data
loadFromLocalStorage(key, defaultValue)

// Food logging
addFoodEntry(foodEntry)
deleteFoodEntry(entryId)

// Exercise logging
addExerciseEntry(exerciseEntry)
deleteExerciseEntry(entryId)

// Calculations
getTotalCaloriesEaten()
getTotalCaloriesBurned()
getRemainingCalories()
```

**How it works:**
1. Takes JavaScript objects
2. Converts to JSON strings (`JSON.stringify()`)
3. Saves to `localStorage.setItem()`
4. Loads with `localStorage.getItem()`
5. Converts back to objects (`JSON.parse()`)

#### 2. `src/components/Dashboard.js`

**Purpose**: Main daily tracking interface

**State Variables:**
```javascript
const [foodName, setFoodName] = useState('');
const [foodCalories, setFoodCalories] = useState('');
const [foodLog, setFoodLog] = useState([]);

const [exerciseName, setExerciseName] = useState('');
const [exerciseCalories, setExerciseCalories] = useState('');
const [exerciseLog, setExerciseLog] = useState([]);

const [caloriesEaten, setCaloriesEaten] = useState(0);
const [caloriesBurned, setCaloriesBurned] = useState(0);
const [remainingCalories, setRemainingCalories] = useState(0);
```

**Key Functions:**
- `handleAddFood()` - Adds food entry
- `handleAddExercise()` - Adds exercise entry
- `handleDeleteFood()` - Removes food entry
- `handleDeleteExercise()` - Removes exercise entry
- `calculateTotals()` - Updates all totals

**React Hooks Used:**
- `useState` - Manages component state
- `useEffect` - Loads data on mount, recalculates totals

#### 3. `src/components/Dashboard.css`

**Purpose**: Styles for Dashboard component

**Key Sections:**
- `.summary-cards` - Grid layout for top cards
- `.logging-section` - Two-column layout (food/exercise)
- `.log-form` - Input styling
- `.log-entry` - Individual entry styling
- `.guidance` - Helpful message styling

### Updated Files

#### 1. `src/App.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `dailyTarget` state
- Added `currentStep` 4 (Dashboard)
- Added `useEffect` to load saved profile
- Added `handleResultsComplete()` function
- Imports Dashboard component
- Imports localStorage utilities

**New Flow:**
```
Step 1  Step 2  Step 3  Step 4 (Dashboard)
                                
   Reset Button 
```

#### 2. `src/components/Results.js`

**Changes:**
- Added `onComplete` prop
- Added "Continue to Daily Tracker" button
- Calls `onComplete(dailyTarget)` on click
- Styled with `.button-group` for two buttons

---

## React Concepts Used

### State Management

**What is state?**
State is data that can change over time.

**Example:**
```javascript
const [foodLog, setFoodLog] = useState([]);
// foodLog = current value (starts as empty array)
// setFoodLog = function to update it
```

**When state updates, React re-renders the component.**

### useEffect Hook

**Purpose:** Run code at specific times

**Example 1: On mount (load data)**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  loadSavedData();
}, []); // Empty array = only run once
```

**Example 2: When dependencies change**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  calculateTotals();
}, [foodLog, exerciseLog]); // Run when these change
```

### Props (Properties)

**What are props?**
Props pass data from parent to child components.

**Example:**
```javascript
// App.js (parent)
<Dashboard 
  userProfile={userProfile}
  dailyTarget={dailyTarget}
  onReset={resetApp}
/>

// Dashboard.js (child)
function Dashboard({ userProfile, dailyTarget, onReset }) {
  // Can use these values here
}
```

### Event Handlers

**Pattern for handling user input:**

```javascript
// 1. State for input
const [foodName, setFoodName] = useState('');

// 2. onChange handler
<input 
  value={foodName}
  onChange={(e) => setFoodName(e.target.value)}
/>

// 3. Form submit handler
const handleAddFood = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Don't refresh page
  // Process the data
};
```

### Array Methods

**filter()** - Remove items
```javascript
const updatedLog = foodLog.filter(entry => entry.id !== entryId);
```

**map()** - Display items
```javascript
{foodLog.map(entry => (
  <div key={entry.id}>{entry.name}</div>
))}
```

**reduce()** - Calculate totals
```javascript
const total = foodLog.reduce((sum, entry) => sum + entry.calories, 0);
```

## Testing Guide

### What to Test

1. **Food Logging**
   -  Add food entry  appears in list
   -  Delete food entry  removed from list
   -  Total updates correctly
   -  Data persists after refresh

2. **Exercise Logging**
   -  Add exercise  appears in list
   -  Delete exercise  removed from list
   -  Total updates correctly
   -  Data persists after refresh

3. **Calculations**
   -  Remaining = Target - (Eaten - Burned)
   -  Summary cards show correct values
   -  Guidance message updates

4. **localStorage**
   -  Refresh page  data still there
   -  Close browser  reopen  data still there
   -  New day  logs reset
   -  Reset button  all data cleared

### Test Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Basic Logging**
1. Add breakfast (300 cal)
2. Add lunch (500 cal)
3. Check total = 800 cal
4. Add morning run (400 cal burned)
5. Check remaining = Target - (800 - 400)

**Scenario 2: Persistence**
1. Add some food entries
2. Refresh page (F5)
3. Verify entries still there

**Scenario 3: Daily Reset**
1. Change computer date to tomorrow
2. Refresh page
3. Verify food/exercise logs cleared
4. Verify profile and target still saved

## Common Questions

### Q: Where is my data stored?

**A:** In your browser's localStorage. Open DevTools (F12)  Application tab  Local Storage  file:// to see it!

### Q: Can I access my data on another computer?

**A:** No. localStorage is per-browser, per-device. For multi-device sync, you'd need a database/server (future feature).

### Q: What happens if I clear browser data?

**A:** All Hawk Fuel data will be deleted. You'll start fresh from Step 1.

### Q: How accurate are the calorie calculations?

**A:** BMR/TDEE formulas are industry-standard (Mifflin-St Jeor). Activity calories use MET values from scientific research. However, individual metabolism varies - these are estimates!

### Q: Can I change my daily target later?

**A:** Yes! Click "Start New Calculation" to redo your profile and get a new target.

### Q: What if I log something by mistake?

**A:** Click the  button next to any entry to delete it instantly.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Data not saving

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify localStorage is enabled in browser
3. Check if in private/incognito mode (localStorage may be limited)

### Issue: Totals not updating

**Solution:**
1. Check useEffect dependencies in Dashboard.js
2. Verify calculateTotals() is being called
3. Look for console errors

### Issue: Reset doesn't work

**Solution:**
1. Verify resetApp() clears all state
2. Check if localStorage.clear() is called
3. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Date not resetting

**Solution:**
1. Check getTodaysDate() function
2. Verify checkAndResetDaily() is called on load
3. Compare saved date vs current date in DevTools
